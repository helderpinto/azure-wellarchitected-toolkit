# Cost Optimization

Making a cost-effective usage of Azure is a priority for all organizations running applications and services in the cloud. The questions and initiatives below are based on the [Cost Optimization pillar of the Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/). Reflect on each question and priorize/plan the initiatives of the Cost Optimization playbook. For a comprehensive list of Azure cost optimization resources, check out the [Azure FinOps Guide](https://github.com/dolevshor/azure-finops-guide)  

## Questions to make 

* What actions are you taking to optimize cloud costs?
* How do you ensure that cloud resources are appropriately provisioned?
* How is your organization modeling cloud costs?
* How do you manage the storage footprint of your digital assets?
* How are you monitoring your costs?
* What trade-offs have you made to optimize for cost?

## Initiatives

### Capture requirements

The agility provided by the cloud and its pay-per-use consumption model is an opportunity for us to continuously question the requirements of our workloads and look for optimal resource usage according to our needs. No matter we are still in the conception stage of our solution or already managing it in production, evaluating the right Azure services architecture and sizing will determine how cheap or expensive our solution is.

Review your workload requirements in terms of compute, storage, traffic, security, high availability, business continuity, monitoring, management and automation:
* Estimate or measure its costs and ask yourself whether the relative weight or absolute value of each service is aligned with its importance for the solution.
* If necessary, make adjustments to the workload architecture to meet its requirements in a cost optimal manner.

Given its implications and effort required, this is for sure the most demanding initiative. The best and more natural way of incorporating it into your organization practices is bringing cost to all architectural discussions and making it an architectural perspective as important as security, user experience or performance. For a deeper discussion on workload requirements, visit the [Well-Architected guidance on the subject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-capture-requirements).

### Use cost management tools

Don't get it wrong, but using the cloud without visibility over how you spend your money nor how you can optimize your costs is a posture as irresponsible as overlooking security. Here are some actions that should be part of your todo list:

* Implement [resource tagging policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-policies) for cost allocation with Azure Policy, enforcing (denying deployments without tags) and/or automating tag inheritance from resource group tags. You can use as a reference the [Cloud Adoption Framework's recommendations for a tagging strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging).
* Based on expected monthly or daily costs, set up [Cost Management budgets and alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets)
* Establish procedure for periodic Cost Management reporting and Azure Advisor reviews
    * [Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis) in Azure Portal
        * Build shared reports that provide insights about how costs are distributed and evolve over time (e.g., daily costs per meter category or per resource group over the last 30 days, monthly costs per meter category over the last year, etc.)
        * Look for changes in the costs pattern that may be a sign of usage spill
    * [Cost Management connector for Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-cost-management)
        * With this connector, you can build your own custom rich Cost Management reports in Power BI Desktop.
        * Recommended for scenarios not supported by Azure Cost Management in the Azure portal.
    * [Cost Management Power BI App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/analyze-cost-data-azure-cost-management-power-bi-template-app)
        * Get insights about Azure Hybrid Benefit and Reserved Instances usage and savings
        * A Power BI Pro license is required to install and use the app.
        * To connect to data, you must use an Enterprise Administrator account. The Enterprise Administrator (read only) role is supported.
    * Remediate [Azure Advisor cost recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-cost-recommendations).
* Give costs visibility to teams with [appropriate Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/track-costs#provide-the-right-level-of-cost-access). Remember: **if we don't know what we spend, we don't care about how much we spend**.
* Identify custom cost optimization opportunities with the [Azure Optimization Engine](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine)
    * Deploy the engine in your environment and assess the initial results
    * Develop custom recommendations if needed
  
### Use the right consumption model

* Save on permanent costs with [Azure Reservations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) - Azure Advisor does a great job in analyzing your workloads and recommending which are good candidates for Reservations. Leverage those saving opportunities - you can save up to 72% from pay-as-you-go prices.
* Leverage [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/faq/) - bring your on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server licensing to Azure and, together with Reservations, save up to 85% on your Windows/SQL-based Azure workload costs.
* Serverless/consumption-based vs. permanent compute allocation - if you have resource permanently allocated for workloads that have occasional usage, consider rearchitecting your solution to a [serverless consumption model](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/), where you allocate resources only when they're actually needed. Conversely, keeping a serverless approach for workloads that are under constant usage can become less cost and performance efficient when compared to a permanent resource allocation model.
* Consolidate resources when possible (e.g., containerization, multiple databases in same engine/pool, multiple web apps in same App Service plan, etc.)
* Implement [auto-scaling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/autoscale-overview) or automated shutdown/startup (using [Microsoft-supported Start/Stop VMs feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/start-stop-vms/overview) or a simpler custom [PowerShell Automation runbook](./scripts/StartStop-VmsByJsonCondition.ps1)).

### Standardize resources usage

* Implement resource consumption rules with [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) - identify the resource types and service SKUs that your organization requires and limit Azure resource provisioning to allowed types/SKUs with Azure Policy built-in or custom definitions. Denying unapproved resource provisioning can save you from unnecessary cost spikes. Here are some examples of built-in Azure Policies that can help:
    * [Not allowed resource types](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6c112d4e-5bc7-47ae-a041-ea2d9dccd749) (/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/6c112d4e-5bc7-47ae-a041-ea2d9dccd749)
    * [Allowed storage account SKUs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7433c107-6db4-4ad1-b57a-a76dce0154a1) (/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/7433c107-6db4-4ad1-b57a-a76dce0154a1)
    * [Allowed resource types](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa08ec900-254a-4555-9bf5-e42af04b5c5c) (/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/a08ec900-254a-4555-9bf5-e42af04b5c5c)
    * [Allowed virtual machine size SKUs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcccc23c7-8427-4f53-ad12-b6a63eb452b3) (/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/cccc23c7-8427-4f53-ad12-b6a63eb452b3)
* Automate resource provisioning with [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) - by standardizing the way resources are provisioned, e.g., with Azure Resource Manager templates, you will avoid configuration mistakes that sometimes increase the cost of your solutions.

### Eliminate waste

* Implement [lifecycle management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal) in your Storage Accounts, by deleting objects that are no longer needed (e.g., old backups/logs) or by changing their storage tier to a cooler and cheaper option, according to their access patterns.
* If, for some reason, you enabled the [Azure Diagnostics extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostics-extension-overview) in your Virtual Machines, be aware that this can become after some time an important part of your virtual machine Storage-related costs. By default, the extension writes data to Azure Storage Tables (more expensive than Blobs) and it does not support a retention policy for Tables - this means your costs are ever increasing and you don't have an easy way of getting rid of them. If you don't need to collect anymore logs or metrics with the Azure Diagnostics extension, follow the [Azure Diagnostics cleanup guide](diagnostics-extension-cleanup/). With the availability of the new [Azure Monitor Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/azure-monitor-agent-overview), you have even less reasons to keep using the Azure Diagnostics extension.
